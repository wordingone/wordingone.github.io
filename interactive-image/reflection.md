 Excellent work finishing the project.

Here’s your response for the final reflection prompt:

## Explanation: Use of JavaScript Objects or Iteration

Your code primarily uses the **`document` object**, which is part of the **DOM (Document Object Model)** API — an object-based representation of the HTML page. Through this, you access specific elements via `getElementById()`, which returns object references to `<img>`, `<select>`, `<input>`, etc.

While your current implementation **does not explicitly use iteration** (like a `for` loop or `.forEach()`), it **does manipulate object properties** dynamically — for example:

```js
image.style.transform = `rotate(${angle}deg)`;
```

Here:

- `image` is a DOM element object.
- `.style` is an object that holds CSS properties as key–value pairs.
- `.transform` is a string property dynamically modified.

You’re using object property access to **control visual state** in response to input events — a fundamental pattern in interactive web programming.

## Suggestion: Refactor with a Unified `updateRotation(angle)` Function

Right now, you repeat this logic twice:

```js
image.style.transform = `rotate(${angle}deg)`;
rotationSlider.value = angle;
rotationBox.value = angle;
```

Instead, refactor it into one function:

```js
function updateRotation(angle) {
  angle = Math.max(0, Math.min(angle, 360)); // Clamp
  image.style.transform = `rotate(${angle}deg)`;
  rotationSlider.value = angle;
  rotationBox.value = angle;
}
```

Then in your event listeners:

```js
rotationSlider.addEventListener("input", () => {
  updateRotation(rotationSlider.value);
});

rotationBox.addEventListener("input", () => {
  updateRotation(rotationBox.value);
});
```

### Benefit:

- **Cleaner** and **less repetitive**
- Easy to extend if you add animation, rotation label, etc.

##  Short Written Reflection

The comment on object property access to control visual state was quite intriguing. I understood that a huge part of JavaScript, at least for now, is working with assets but controlling how they are perceived based on interactions. The trickiest part was actually having the image rotate in real time, and keeping the slider and numeric input synced correctly. I would probably try to discover more types of input elements in the future and explore ways to make them interdependent. Prompting for deeper explanations around DOM manipulation and state transitions also seems worthwhile for next time.
