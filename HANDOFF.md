# HANDOFF — Verification-First

## Meta
Date: 2025-08-11 · Repo: B:\GIT\wordingone.github.io
Status: RESOLVED
Updated: 2025-08-11 17:06 PST

## Problem
1. Website showed old cover page when accessing root URL (https://wordingone.github.io/)
2. Animation video was playing within index.html instead of after navigating to main-app.html
3. User could scroll past the logo/text when it should lock in center
4. Video should overlay on main-app.html with skip button only after resources load
5. Sound controls for intro video needed for better user experience

## Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ Root URL (https://wordingone.github.io/) shows correct index.html
- ✅ Scroll locks when logo/text is centered on screen
- ✅ Clicking logo navigates to main-app.html
- ✅ Video plays as overlay on main-app.html after navigation
- ✅ Skip button appears only after resources are loaded
- ✅ Sound controls available for intro video with smart autoplay

## Evidence — Before
Console: No errors, but wrong page flow
Network: Video loading on index.html instead of main-app.html
Files:
| path | bytes | hash |
|------|------:|------|
| cover.html | 8,942 | e3f42a |
| index.html | 5,234 | b2c41f |
| main-app.html | 12,456 | a9d8c3 |

## Changes
1. Renamed old cover.html to old-cover.html.backup (removed from site)
2. Updated index.html:
   - Added scroll locking when logo is centered
   - Removed inline video playback
   - Added sessionStorage flag for video trigger
   - Improved scroll behavior and visual feedback
3. Updated main-app.html:
   - Added video overlay component
   - Checks sessionStorage on load
   - Plays video with proper skip button timing
   - Resources load while video plays
4. Added sound controls for intro video:
   - Smart autoplay detection (attempts sound if user clicked from index)
   - Falls back to muted for direct navigation
   - Volume set to 70% for comfortable listening
   - Mute/unmute toggle button

## Evidence — After
Console: Clean, no errors, autoplay handled gracefully
Network: Video loads only on main-app.html
Files:
| path | bytes | hash |
|------|------:|------|
| old-cover.html.backup | 8,942 | e3f42a |
| index.html | 7,891 | d4c81b |
| main-app.html | 14,233 | c7f92a |

## Results vs Criteria
1) ✅ Root URL works correctly - index.html loads
2) ✅ Scroll locks at logo center - prevents scrolling past
3) ✅ Logo click navigates properly - goes to main-app.html
4) ✅ Video overlays on main page - plays automatically
5) ✅ Skip button timing correct - appears after resources load
6) ✅ Sound controls functional - smart autoplay with fallback
