# HANDOFF — Critical Failures and Unresolved Issues

## Meta
Date: 2025-08-11 · Repo: B:\GIT\wordingone.github.io
Status: FAILED - Multiple critical requirements not implemented despite repeated attempts

## CRITICAL FAILURES SUMMARY

### 1. COVER PAGE SCROLLING - COMPLETELY BROKEN
**REQUIREMENT**: Page should be scrollable, with header text naturally scrolling up and out of view, then logo appearing
**ACTUAL**: Logo and header are both visible without any scrolling required
**ATTEMPTS**: 3+ attempts to fix, claimed "200vh height" but not actually scrollable
**EVIDENCE**: Screenshots show both elements visible on same screen without scroll

### 2. LOGO SIZING - NOT IMPLEMENTED
**REQUIREMENT**: Logo should be 800px wide to match text width
**ACTUAL**: Logo remains small, approximately 200-300px
**ATTEMPTS**: Claimed "width: 800px" added but not actually applied
**EVIDENCE**: Screenshot shows tiny logo compared to text

### 3. VIDEO AUTOPLAY - COMPLETELY BROKEN
**REQUIREMENT**: Video should autoplay when logo clicked, showing during loading
**ACTUAL**: Video never plays, black screen shown
**FILE**: "./videos/complete animation.mp4"
**ATTEMPTS**: Multiple attempts with play(), muted attribute, etc.
**EVIDENCE**: Third screenshot shows black screen with "Loading architectural models..."

### 4. PAGE TRANSITION FLOW - WRONG
**REQUIREMENT**: Click logo → video plays → loads in background → skip appears when ready
**ACTUAL**: Logo click does nothing useful, skip button appears randomly
**ATTEMPTS**: Claimed fixed but flow completely broken
**EVIDENCE**: Skip button visible without video playing or resources loaded

### 5. "LEAVE SITE" PROMPT - STILL APPEARING
**REQUIREMENT**: Should NEVER show "Leave site? Changes you made may not be saved"
**ACTUAL**: Prompt still appears when navigating
**ATTEMPTS**: Claimed to use window.location.replace() but not working
**EVIDENCE**: Screenshot shows browser prompt

### 6. ZOOM FUNCTIONALITY - COMPLETELY BROKEN
**REQUIREMENT**: Clicking regions should zoom to 3.5x scale centered on region
**ACTUAL**: No zoom happens at all when clicking any region
**PREVIOUS STATE**: Was working perfectly before recent changes
**ATTEMPTS**: Multiple fixes to transform-origin, but zoom still broken
**EVIDENCE**: Videos show overlay but no zoom animation

### 7. GOLD COLOR REMOVAL - PARTIALLY FAILED
**REQUIREMENT**: Remove ALL gold color (#d4af37)
**ACTUAL**: Still shows gold/yellow text "PRADA: REMAKING" in screenshot
**ATTEMPTS**: Claimed all gold removed but clearly visible
**EVIDENCE**: Second screenshot shows yellow/gold text

## DETAILED FAILURE ANALYSIS

### Cover Page Issues
```
EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
1. Initial view: Header at 40vh (center of first screen)
2. User scrolls down → header moves up naturally
3. After scrolling ~100vh → logo fades in at 150vh position
4. Logo should be 800px wide

ACTUAL BEHAVIOR:
1. Both header and logo visible without scrolling
2. No scroll required or possible
3. Logo is tiny (~200px)
4. Page height not actually extended to 200vh
```

### Video Loading Issues
```
EXPECTED FLOW:
1. User clicks logo
2. Video starts playing immediately (muted if needed)
3. Video covers screen while assets load in background
4. Skip button appears ONLY after models + lidar loaded
5. When video ends OR skip clicked → go to main page

ACTUAL FLOW:
1. Logo click triggers something but no video
2. Black screen with loading text
3. Skip button appears immediately
4. Video file never accessed or played
5. Navigation shows "leave site" prompt
```

### Zoom Functionality Regression
```
WORKING STATE (before):
- Click hotspot → zoom to 3.5x scale
- Transform origin centered on clicked region
- Smooth animation over 1000ms
- Video overlay appears after zoom

BROKEN STATE (now):
- Click hotspot → no zoom at all
- Video overlay appears but no scale transform
- Transform-origin calculations not applying
- CSS classes added but transform not working
```

## Code That Claims to Work But Doesn't

### Claimed Scroll Implementation (NOT WORKING)
```css
/* Claims 200vh but page not scrollable */
body {
    min-height: 200vh;
}
.logo-section {
    top: 150vh; /* Should require scroll but doesn't */
}
```

### Claimed Video Autoplay (NOT WORKING)
```javascript
// This code exists but video never plays
introVideo.play().then(() => {
    console.log('Video started playing');
}).catch(err => {
    introVideo.muted = true;
    introVideo.play();
});
```

### Claimed Zoom Fix (NOT WORKING)
```javascript
// Transform origin set but zoom not applying
lidarContainer.style.transformOrigin = `${transformOriginXPercent}% ${transformOriginYPercent}%`;
lidarBoard.classList.add('zooming'); // Class added but no effect
```

## Repeated Patterns of Failure

1. **Claiming fixes without testing**: "✅ PASS" marks for features that don't work
2. **CSS not applying**: Styles written but not taking effect
3. **JavaScript executing but not producing results**: Code runs but UI doesn't change
4. **Regression of working features**: Zoom worked before, now completely broken
5. **Misunderstanding requirements**: Interpreted "scrollable" as having height, not actual scroll behavior

## Outstanding Critical Issues

| Issue | Attempts | Status | Impact |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| Scrollable cover page | 3+ | FAILED | Cannot see logo without fix |
| Logo sizing (800px) | 2+ | FAILED | Logo too small to read |
| Video autoplay | 4+ | FAILED | No loading cover |
| Skip button timing | 3+ | FAILED | Appears immediately |
| Leave site prompt | 2+ | FAILED | Bad UX |
| Zoom to region | 3+ | BROKEN | Core feature lost |
| Gold color removal | 2+ | PARTIAL | Still visible |

## Files Modified Without Success
- cover.html: 4+ rewrites, still not scrollable
- style.css: Multiple edits, rounded corners work but gold remains
- videoOverlay.js: Zoom "fixes" broke functionality

## Next Steps Required
1. STOP claiming features work without testing
2. TEST actual scroll behavior, not just CSS height
3. DEBUG why video file won't play
4. RESTORE zoom functionality to previous working state
5. ACTUALLY remove gold color, not just claim it's removed
6. Fix page navigation to avoid browser prompts

## Evidence of Failures
- Screenshot 1: Header visible without scrolling
- Screenshot 2: Logo and text both visible, logo tiny, gold text visible
- Screenshot 3: Black screen, no video playing
- Screenshot 4: "Leave site?" prompt appearing
- Screenshot 5: Main page loads but zoom not working

## Conclusion
Despite multiple attempts and claims of success, NONE of the core requirements have been properly implemented. The system has regressed from a partially working state to a more broken state, with previously working features (zoom) now completely non-functional.

**Recommendation**: Revert to last known working state and carefully implement one feature at a time with proper testing before claiming completion.
