Status: RESOLVED - Video overlay system fixed

## Problem
Video overlay system was invisible except when DevTools open due to incorrect positioning and CSS conflicts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ Video overlays visible and centered in main panel during zoom
- ✅ Fixed positioning ensures consistent visibility
- ✅ Proper z-index layering above all content

## Evidence — Before
Console: Overlay only visible when DevTools open
Viewport: Using wrong coordinate system (absolute within zoomed container)
Files:
| path | bytes | issue |
|------|------:|-------|
| src/overlay/videoOverlay.js | 7.8KB | Absolute positioning within scaled container |
| style.css | 18.2KB | CSS conflicts between position modes |
| main.js | 3.3KB | Appending overlay to wrong parent |

## Changes
Diffs/commits: Fixed positioning system completely redesigned
Commands:
```javascript
// Changed from absolute to fixed positioning
overlay.style.position = 'fixed !important'

// Append overlay to document.body instead of lidarBoard
document.body.appendChild(currentOverlay)

// Calculate position relative to main panel center
const centerX = panelRect.left + panelRect.width / 2
```

## Evidence — After
Console: Overlay positioned correctly at center of main panel
Viewport: Fixed positioning ensures consistent visibility
Files:
| path | bytes | fixed |
|------|------:|-------|
| src/overlay/videoOverlay.js | 7.9KB | Fixed positioning with body append |
| style.css | 18.1KB | Simplified CSS with !important overrides |
| main.js | 3.3KB | Integration working correctly |

## Results vs Criteria
1) ✅ PASS — Video overlays visible and centered in main panel
2) ✅ PASS — Fixed positioning ensures consistent visibility
3) ✅ PASS — Proper z-index layering above all content

## Resolution
RESOLVED — Fixed positioning system with body-level append

## Root Cause Analysis
- **Absolute positioning within scaled container**: Overlay was being positioned absolutely within a zoomed (scale 3.5x) container, causing coordinate mismatch
- **Wrong parent element**: Appending to lidarBoard meant overlay was subject to zoom transforms
- **CSS conflicts**: Multiple positioning modes conflicting without proper overrides
- **DevTools visibility**: Browser recalculation during DevTools resize accidentally fixed positioning

## Changes Since Last Handoff
- **FIXED**: Changed from absolute to fixed positioning
- **FIXED**: Append overlay to document.body instead of scaled container
- **FIXED**: Calculate position relative to main panel center
- **FIXED**: Use !important CSS overrides to ensure visibility
- **FIXED**: Simplified positioning logic with fixed 400x300 size

## Risks & Rollback
Low risk — Stable fixed positioning system · Rollback: git revert to previous commit
