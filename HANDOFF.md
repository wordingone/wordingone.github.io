# HANDOFF — Website Navigation Flow Fix

## Meta
Date: 2025-01-28 · Repo: B:\GIT\wordingone.github.io
Status: RESOLVED
Updated: 2025-01-28 20:21 PST

## Problem
1. Website showed old cover page when accessing root URL (https://wordingone.github.io/)
2. Animation video was playing within index.html instead of after navigating to main-app.html
3. User could scroll past the logo/text when it should lock in center
4. Video should overlay on main-app.html with skip button only after resources load

## Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ Root URL (https://wordingone.github.io/) shows correct index.html
- ✅ Scroll locks when logo/text is centered on screen
- ✅ Clicking logo navigates to main-app.html
- ✅ Video plays as overlay on main-app.html after navigation
- ✅ Skip button appears only after resources are loaded

## Evidence — Before
Console: No errors, but wrong page flow
Network: Video loading on index.html instead of main-app.html
Files:
| path | status |
|------|--------|
| cover.html | Duplicate with wrong redirect |
| index.html | Video playing inline |
| main-app.html | No video overlay |

## Changes
1. Renamed old cover.html to old-cover.html.backup (removed from site)
2. Updated index.html:
   - Added scroll locking when logo is centered
   - Removed inline video playback
   - Added sessionStorage flag for video trigger
   - Improved scroll behavior and visual feedback
3. Updated main-app.html:
   - Added video overlay component
   - Checks sessionStorage on load
   - Plays video with proper skip button timing
   - Resources load while video plays

## Evidence — After
Console: Clean, no errors
Network: Video loads only on main-app.html
Files:
| path | status |
|------|--------|
| old-cover.html.backup | Archived |
| index.html | Fixed scroll lock & navigation |
| main-app.html | Video overlay working |

## Results vs Criteria
1) ✅ Root URL works correctly - index.html loads
2) ✅ Scroll locks at logo center - prevents scrolling past
3) ✅ Logo click navigates properly - goes to main-app.html
4) ✅ Video overlays on main page - plays automatically
5) ✅ Skip button timing correct - appears after resources load

## Resolution
RESOLVED — All acceptance criteria met. Navigation flow now works as specified:
1. User scrolls down to see logo
2. Scroll locks when logo is centered
3. Click logo to navigate to main app
4. Video plays as overlay on main app
5. Skip button appears after resources load

- Analyzed full repo structure (10 GLB models, 26 MP4 videos)
- Confirmed ES6 modular loading system in place
- Verified LFS disabled for web deployment (all binaries served directly)
