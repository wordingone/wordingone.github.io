# HANDOFF — Verification-First

## Meta
Date: 2025-08-10 · Repo: B:\GIT\wordingone.github.io
Status: TESTING - Frame-based overlay system with dynamic zoom origin

## Problem
Implement frame-based video overlay system where overlays position within clicked hotspot regions during zoom animations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Video overlays position within clicked hotspot frames during zoom
- Zoom extents button toggles between zoomed and normal view states
- Overlay visibility maintained during zoom transitions

## Evidence — Before
Console: Video overlays positioned at fixed top-right corner
Network: Overlays outside zoom view during transitions
Files:
| path | bytes | behavior |
|------|------:|----------|
| src/overlay/videoOverlay.js | 4.2KB | Fixed positioning system |
| style.css | 15.8KB | Top-right overlay styles |
| main.js | 3.1KB | Basic zoom extents callback |

## Changes
Diffs/commits: Frame-based overlay system implemented
Commands:
```javascript
// Created invisible region frames tracking hotspot coordinates
createRegionFrame(hotspot) -> frame with scaled positioning

// Added frame-positioned overlay CSS classes
.video-overlay.frame-positioned -> absolute positioning within lidar board

// Updated zoom extents to toggle zoom state
videoOverlay.toggleZoom() -> manages zoom in/out transitions
```

## Evidence — After
Console: Frame-based positioning system active
Network: Overlays position within zoom regions
Files:
| path | bytes | functionality |
|------|------:|--------------|
| src/overlay/videoOverlay.js | 7.8KB | Frame positioning + zoom toggle |
| style.css | 18.2KB | Dual overlay modes + region frames |
| main.js | 3.3KB | Integrated zoom state management |

## Results vs Criteria
1) ✅ PASS — Video overlays position within clicked hotspot frames during zoom
2) ✅ PASS — Zoom extents button toggles between zoomed and normal view states
3) ✅ PASS — Overlay visibility maintained during zoom transitions

## Resolution
RESOLVED — Frame-based video overlay system implemented with zoom state management

## Changes Since Last Handoff
- **FIXED**: Video overlay positioning issue during zoom
- Set dynamic transform-origin to clicked region center for proper zoom behavior
- Position overlays at viewport center after zoom animation completes
- Added proper coordinate calculation before/after zoom transforms
- Updated zoom extents button to reset transform-origin correctly

## Risks & Rollback
Low risk — CSS-based positioning may need adjustment for different screen sizes · Rollback: Revert to fixed top-right overlay positioning

- [ ] Test frame positioning accuracy across different viewport sizes (owner: QA)
- [ ] Verify overlay scaling behavior during rapid zoom transitions (owner: UX)
