# HANDOFF — Mobile & Desktop Fixes Applied

## Meta
Date: 2025-08-13 · Repo: B:\GIT\wordingone.github.io
Status: **FIXES APPLIED - TESTING REQUIRED**
Updated: 2025-08-13 (Latest Fix)

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### Issue 1: Question Marks Too Large on Mobile
**File:** `style.css`
**Lines:** 480-518 (added new mobile media queries)
**Problem:** Hotspot question marks were always 28px regardless of screen size
**Solution:** Added responsive sizing:
- Desktop: 28px (unchanged)
- Tablet (≤768px): 20px
- Mobile (≤480px): 18px

### Issue 2: Video Overlay Not Scaling on Mobile
**File:** `responsive.additions.css`
**Lines:** 149-175
**Problem:** Video overlay positioning conflicts between desktop and mobile styles
**Solution:** Enhanced mobile overrides to force full-screen display with proper z-index

### Issue 3: Logo Scroll Glitch (Desktop & Mobile)
**File:** `index.html`
**Lines:** 86 (CSS), 345-370 (JavaScript)
**Problem:** Logo positioned at 180vh but detection at 1.8 viewports caused misalignment
**Solution:** 
- Changed logo position from 180vh to 150vh
- Adjusted scroll detection from 1.8 to 1.3 viewports
- Fixed scroll lock target to match detection

## Exact Code Changes

### style.css (Lines 404-421)
```css
/* Added mobile-specific hotspot sizing */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .hotspot::after {
        width: 20px;
        height: 20px;
        font-size: 10px;
    }
}

@media (max-width: 480px) {
    .hotspot::after {
        width: 18px;
        height: 18px;
        font-size: 9px;
    }
}
```

### index.html
```javascript
// Line 86: Changed logo position
top: 150vh; /* Reduced from 180vh */

// Line 346: Fixed scroll detection
const logoTargetScroll = viewportHeight * 1.3; // Changed from 1.8

// Line 350: Earlier logo reveal
if (scrollY > viewportHeight * 1.0) { // Changed from 1.2

// Line 368: Match lock position to detection
const targetScroll = viewportHeight * 1.3; // Changed from 1.8
```

### responsive.additions.css (Lines 149-175)
```css
/* Enhanced mobile video overlay overrides */
.video-overlay {
    position: fixed !important;
    top: 0 !important;
    left: 0 !important;
    right: 0 !important;
    bottom: 0 !important;
    /* ... full viewport coverage ... */
}
```
