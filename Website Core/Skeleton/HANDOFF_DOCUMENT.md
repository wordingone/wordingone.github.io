## Project Overview: Interactive Navigation System

### 🎯 Core Concept
Build an **interactive "board + model" navigator** where users explore a high-resolution LiDAR-scanned image through a synchronized 3D architectural model. Each component in the 3D model corresponds 1:1 to sections of the board image.

### ✅ Current Implementation Status

**What's Built (Functional):**

- **GPU-optimized rendering pipeline** (~1-2% GPU usage idle)
- **Baked lighting system** using vertex colors for visual definition
- **Event-driven rendering** (only renders during user interaction)
- **Orthographic camera** for architectural axonometric view

### 🎮 Interaction Contract (Critical Requirements)

**Board Interactions:**
- **Pan:** RMB drag (desktop), one-finger drag (touch, no UI conflicts)
- **Zoom:** Wheel/pinch, anchored at pointer position
- **Select:** LMB click/tap → fires `select(areaId)`

**Model Interactions:**
- **Rotate:** LMB drag to rotate model view
- **Select:** LMB click/tap on component → fires `select(areaId)`

**Synchronization Rules:**
- `select(areaId)` is the **single source of truth**
- Both surfaces subscribe to selection events
- Model auto-rotates based on board viewport center ("crosshair")
- Highlights appear simultaneously on both surfaces

### 📱 User Flows (MVP Implementation)

1. **Explore Flow:**
   - User pans/zooms board → model auto-rotates to show section under crosshair
   - Both surfaces highlight corresponding areas in real-time

2. **Jump Flow:**
   - User clicks model component → board zooms/centers to that area
   - Highlight persists on both surfaces

3. **Inspect Flow:**
   - User clicks board area → lightweight focus ring appears
   - Optional detail overlay shown
   - ESC or outside-click dismisses

3. **Grid Space:** 33×33 area indices for 1:1 mapping
4. **Viewport Space:** Screen/CSS coordinates for UI interaction

**Transformation Pipeline:**
```
Viewport Click → Screen Coords → Board Space → Grid Index → Model Component → Highlight
```
